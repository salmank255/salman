I am a Research Fellow at the Visual Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Oxford Brookes University. I have completed my PhD in 2023 under the supervision of [Prof. Fabio Cuzzolin](https://cms.brookes.ac.uk/staff/FabioCuzzolin/) at the same institution. Prior to this, I completed my Master's in 2020 at Sejong University, South Korea, supervised by [Prof. Sung Wook Baik](https://sejong.elsevierpure.com/en/persons/sung-wook-baik) and [Dr. Khan Muhammad](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=k5oUZyQAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on action and activity recognition/detection, epistemic uncertainty,  continual learning, surgical robotics, and fire & smoke detection/segmentation. I am deeply committed to pushing the boundaries of AI's capabilities and collaborating with fellow researchers to address complex challenges in the field.
